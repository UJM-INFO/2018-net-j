# What work vs What does not work

In the following table we will list the different functionalities that our protocol should contains, and the state of each function

|Functions                |State                          |
|----------------|-------------------------------|
|Create Member|                  OK     |
|Add member to the tracker         |OK       |
|Synchronize the memeber list          |OK|
|Get the memeber list          |OK|
|Listening to network          |OK|
|Get blocks from other members          |OK|
|Create new block          |OK|
|Validate a received block         |OK|
|Add the block to the Chain          |OK|
|drop a duplicated/non valid block          |OK|

# Initial vs Current objectives

Our initial objective was to build a protocol assuring basic functionalities, and develop theme after. At this stage, we can say that we could run those functionalities. such as making transactions, creating blocks and ensure the communication between the different entities.

# Difficulties we faced

During this project, the difficulties that we faced are the following:

 1. It took us a while to model our protocol, and understand the
    interaction between its entities
 2. Transform the ideas into code lines was a difficulty for some
    members of the team

# Lessons wou learned
During this project, the lessonswe learnt are the following:

 1. Applied the theoretical knowledge that we studied.
 2.  Familiarize with the python development
