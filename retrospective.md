# Project organization

To organize our project, we opt an agile methodology. Which means that we followed a cyclic development life cycle.

We started by defining the minimal functionalities that the protocol must have to run properly.

Then we split the tasks between the groups members, every task must take at maximum 3 days, but we faced some issues for some functionalities, and it took us more than we expected.

In addition to that, one of the problem that prevent us from respecting the planning is the surprising tasks and labs session we had to submit for the other subjects.

Those factors were the causes of the non-correlation between the expected and real planning.

When the development of a function is done, we go through a test process, to make sure that the function run well, the type of test that we made are unit tests, when a function succeed the test, it will be pushed to the repository.

# Difficulties we faced

During this project, the difficulties that we faced are the following:

 1. It took us a while to model our protocol, and understand the
    interaction between its entities
 2. Transform the ideas into code lines was a difficulty for some
    members of the team
 3. Synchronizing between the different projects we have to submit

# Lessons wou learned
During this project, the lessons we learnt are the following:

 1. Applied the theoretical knowledge that we studied.
 2. Familiarize with the python development
 
 # What you would do differently
 Starting the project in an early stage, could be more benificial
