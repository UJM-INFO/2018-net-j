# Project organization

To organize our project, we opt an agile methodology. Which means that we followed a cyclic development life cycle.

We started by defining the minimal functionalities that the protocol must have to run properly.

Then we split the tasks between the groups members, every task must take at maximum 3 days, but we faced some issues for some functionalities, and it took us more than we expected.

In addition to that, one of the problem that prevent us from respecting the planning is the surprising tasks and labs session we had to submit for the other subjects.

Those factors were the causes of the non-correlation between the expected and real planning.

When the development of a function is done, we go through a test process, to make sure that the function run well, the type of test that we made are unit tests, when a function succeed the test, it will be pushed to the repository.
